# Intro to Algorithmic Trading with Interactive Brokers C++ API

### **IMPORTANT NOTE**
#####*We are not liable for any mishaps in order executions, data feeds, etc. that lead to financial losses. It is assumed that you test all of these programs out in a paper trading account before using them in a live trading environment.*

This is a project built on top of [Jan Boonen's Implementation for the C++ API](https://github.com/JanBoonen/TwsApiCpp) to make it easier for those with little experience with automated trading strategies or algorithmic trading in general.

Our testing has been done on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04), but just follow the instructions on [Jan Boonen's Project](https://github.com/JanBoonen/TwsApiCpp) to see how to compile on other systems.

Feel free to contact us at any time for questions or comments. If you have any ideas of your own, help us make the finance industry more open and submit a pull request!
